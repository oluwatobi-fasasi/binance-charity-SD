I am excited to share a QR code that I have designed using HTML and CSS. QR codes are becoming increasingly popular as a quick and easy way to share information, and I wanted to experiment with creating my own custom design.

Through the use of HTML and CSS, I was able to create a unique and eye-catching QR code. I used a combination of CSS properties to create the distinctive pattern of the QR code, while also adding some additional styling to make it more visually appealing.

I am thrilled with the outcome of this project and believe that it is a great showcase of my skills in web development. In addition to creating a functional QR code, I was also able to apply my knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a visually pleasing design.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project!
